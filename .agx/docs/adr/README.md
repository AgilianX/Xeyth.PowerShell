## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) help us:

1. Document important architectural decisions
2. Understand the context and rationale behind these decisions
3. Communicate these decisions to team members
4. Provide historical context for future reference

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: Background and problem statement
- **Decision**: The approach we've chosen
- **Consequences**: Results and impacts of the decision
- **References**: Additional information and related documents
